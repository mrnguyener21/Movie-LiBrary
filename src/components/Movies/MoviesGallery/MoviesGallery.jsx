// match up the genre numbers to switch between which genre is currently shown
// figure out how to connect ito the genre drop down
// split up the different genres in the genre drop down, right now it's considerd as one item
// maybe create a switch statement in the genre drop down so then based on what you click a the title will be sent to the home page. based on that we will know which genre to show? write this out on paper later. ACTUALLY creating a state would be better since i can create one in the actions file and then just import it into the appropriate files.
